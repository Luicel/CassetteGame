Abandoned prototype for a 2D platformer game about a guy with a cassette player for a head going on an "epic" journey. Players could combine the unique properties of different cassette tapes to perform crazy movement sequences. All while doing so, they would be guided along a collection of silly and enjoyable journeys. Examples of these cassette tapes are:

- Red: While equipped, the player cannot jump; however, “hidden” platforms will be revealed.
- Green: While equipped, the player’s gravity is reversed.
- Blue: Upon equipping, the player can perform one mid-air dash. This limit resets itself upon the player coming into contact with the ground.
